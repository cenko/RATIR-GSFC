------------ LRISAUTO (Perley's LRIS pipeline) QUICK START GUIDE --------------

Setup information:

   For use on a Caltech astronomy cluster machine, see citsetup.txt.

   For custom installation, see lrisauto.txt and scroll down to "installation".


Manual:
  
   See lrisauto.txt (or the header of lrisautoproc.pro) for full instructions
   on use of the pipeline


Quick start guide:

   Typical reduction of an LRIS night will proceed as follows:

   1. Create a reduction directory on a drive with plenty of free space.

   2. Create a subdirectory for the raw data with a name such as "raw/".

   3. Copy over the raw LRIS files you wish to reduce into the raw data
      directory.

   4. Delete any known bad files (such as focus images, mira output, broken 
      shutter, wrong binning/windowing, arc lamps not warm, stuck grating, 
      etc.) from the raw data directory.  This step is optional but may save
      some processing time and reduce the risk of failure.

   5. Start IDL by typing "idl".

   6. Run the pipeline at the IDL prompt as follows: 
        IDL>   lrisautoproc, datadir='raw/', chip='r'

   7. Wait patiently for the results.  Final reduced spectra will be output as
        ascii tables to the current directory as lris[name].spec  Reduced 
        images will appear in imredux/ as coadd[name]_r.fits. (In the future,
        these will appear in the current directory as well.)  Intermediate data
        products are written to imredux/ and spredux/.

   8. To make a summary plot of all the spectra, type:
       IDL>   lrisplotall
        And open the file lrisspectra.ps to view the plots.
