Manual:
  
   See manual.txt (or the header of ratautoproc.pro) for full instructions
   on use of the pipeline


Quick start guide:

   Typical reduction of an RATIR night will proceed as follows:

   1. Create a reduction directory on a drive with plenty of free space.

   2. Create a subdirectory for the raw data with a name such as "raw/".

   3. Copy over the raw RATIR files you wish to reduce into the raw data
      	directory.

   4. Delete any known bad files from the raw data directory.  
	This step is optional but may save
      	some processing time and reduce the risk of failure.

   5. Move master flats (format flat_[filter: 0,1,z,y,j,h].fits) into imredux/

   6. Start IDL by typing "idl".

   7. Run the pipeline at the IDL prompt as follows: 
        IDL>   ratautoproc, datadir='raw/'

   8. Wait patiently for the results.  Reduced images will appear in imredux/ as 		coadd[target]_[filter: r,i,Z,Y,J,H].fits.  Intermediate data
       products are written to imredux/.

   9. Move coadd*.fits files to new subdirectory with a name such as "photometry/"
