Instructions for use on a CIT astronomy cluster machine:

For machines connected to the Caltech astronomy cluster, you can run the 
latest release version of the lrisauto LRIS reduction pipeline without 
having to actually install any software.  


----- For IDL users:

If a .idlenv file exists in your home directory, open it and add the following
string to your IDL_PATH keyword:

  :+/home/dperley/progs/idl/lrisauto:+/home/dperley/progs/idl/lrisauto/dependencies

If you don't already have the GCFC IDLastro package installed, also add:

  :+/home/dperley/progs/idl/gsfc/pro
 


----- For non-IDL users:

If you don't already have an .idlenv file in your home directory, then add the
following line to your .cshrc file:

   source ~/.idlenv

Then create the file .idlenv in your home directory and add the following line:
   
   setenv IDL_PATH /home/dperley/progs/idl/lrisauto:+/home/dperley/progs/idl/lrisauto/dependencies:+/home/dperley/progs/idl/gsfc/pro
